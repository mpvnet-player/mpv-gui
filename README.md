mpv-gui is a experimental GUI for the mpv command line player.

Design goals:

- Beginner friendly
- Cross-platform
- mpv compatible

It's not yet clear which UI toolkits are suitable,
because of that multiple frontends are developed
in parallel with a shared backend.

The project/application name is also not yet clear.
